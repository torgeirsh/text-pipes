{- $intro
    This package provides @pipes@ utilities for /text streams/ or /character streams/, 
    realized as streams of 'Text' chunks. The individual chunks are uniformly /strict/, 
    and thus you will generally want @Data.Text@ in scope.  But the type 
    @Producer Text m r@ ,as we are using it, is a sort of /pipes/ equivalent of the lazy @Text@ type. 
    
    This particular module provides many functions equivalent in one way or another to 
    the pure functions in 
    <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-1.1.0.0/docs/Data-Text-Lazy.html Data.Text.Lazy>. 
    They transform, divide, group and fold text streams. Though @Producer Text m r@ 
    is the type of \'effectful Text\', the functions in this module are \'pure\' 
    in the sense that they are uniformly monad-independent.
    Simple /IO/ operations are defined in @Pipes.Text.IO@ -- as lazy IO @Text@ 
    operations are in @Data.Text.Lazy.IO@. Inter-operation with @ByteString@ 
    is provided in @Pipes.Text.Encoding@, which parallels @Data.Text.Lazy.Encoding@. 

    The Text type exported by @Data.Text.Lazy@ is basically that of a lazy list of 
    strict Text: the implementation is arranged so that the individual strict 'Text' 
    chunks are kept to a reasonable size; the user is not aware of the divisions 
    between the connected 'Text' chunks. 
    So also here: the functions in this module are designed to operate on streams that
    are insensitive to text boundaries. This means that they may freely split
    text into smaller texts and /discard empty texts/.  The objective, though, is 
    that they should /never concatenate texts/ in order to provide strict upper 
    bounds on memory usage.  

    For example, to stream only the first three lines of 'stdin' to 'stdout' you
    might write:

> import Pipes
> import qualified Pipes.Text as Text
> import qualified Pipes.Text.IO as Text
> import Pipes.Group (takes')
> import Lens.Family 
> 
> main = runEffect $ takeLines 3 Text.stdin >-> Text.stdout
>   where 
>     takeLines n = Text.unlines . takes' n . view Text.lines

    The above program will never bring more than one chunk of text (~ 32 KB) into
    memory, no matter how long the lines are.

-}
{- $lenses
    As this example shows, one superficial difference from @Data.Text.Lazy@ 
    is that many of the operations, like 'lines', are \'lensified\'; this has a 
    number of advantages (where it is possible); in particular it facilitates their 
    use with 'Parser's of Text (in the general <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-parse-3.0.1/docs/Pipes-Parse-Tutorial.html pipes-parse> 
    sense.) The disadvantage, famously, is that the messages you get for type errors can be
    a little alarming. The remarks that follow in this section are for non-lens adepts.

    Each lens exported here, e.g. 'lines', 'chunksOf' or 'splitAt', reduces to the 
    intuitively corresponding function when used with @view@ or @(^.)@. Instead of
    writing:
    
    > splitAt 17 producer
    
    as we would with the Prelude or Text functions, we write 
    
    > view (splitAt 17) producer
    
    or equivalently
    
    > producer ^. splitAt 17

    This may seem a little indirect, but note that many equivalents of 
    @Text -> Text@ functions are exported here as 'Pipe's. Here too we recover the intuitively 
    corresponding functions by prefixing them with @(>->)@. Thus something like

>  stripLines = Text.unlines . Group.maps (>-> Text.stripStart) . view Text.lines 

    would drop the leading white space from each line. 

    The lenses in this library are marked as /improper/; this just means that 
    they don't admit all the operations of an ideal lens, but only /getting/ and /focusing/. 
    Just for this reason, though, the magnificent complexities of the lens libraries 
    are a distraction. The lens combinators to keep in mind, the ones that make sense for 
    our lenses, are @view@ \/ @(^.)@), @over@ \/ @(%~)@ , and @zoom@. 

    One need only keep in mind that if @l@ is a @Lens' a b@, then:

-}
{- $view
    @view l@ is a function @a -> b@ . Thus @view l a@ (also written @a ^. l@ ) 
    is the corresponding @b@; as was said above, this function will be exactly the 
    function you think it is, given its name. Thus to uppercase the first n characters 
    of a Producer, leaving the rest the same, we could write: 


    > upper n p = do p' <- p ^. Text.splitAt n >-> Text.toUpper
    >                p'
-}
{- $over
    @over l@ is a function @(b -> b) -> a -> a@.  Thus, given a function that modifies
    @b@s, the lens lets us modify an @a@ by applying @f :: b -> b@ to 
    the @b@ that we can \"see\" through the lens. So  @over l f :: a -> a@ 
    (it can also be written @l %~ f@). 
    For any particular @a@, then, @over l f a@ or @(l %~ f) a@ is a revised @a@. 
    So above we might have written things like these: 

    > stripLines = Text.lines %~ maps (>-> Text.stripStart)
    > stripLines = over Text.lines (maps (>-> Text.stripStart))
    > upper n    =  Text.splitAt n %~ (>-> Text.toUpper)

-}
{- $zoom
    @zoom l@, finally, is a function from a @Parser b m r@  
    to a @Parser a m r@ (or more generally a @StateT (Producer b m x) m r@).  
    Its use is easiest to see with an decoding lens like 'utf8', which
    \"sees\" a Text producer hidden inside a ByteString producer:
    @drawChar@ is a Text parser, returning a @Maybe Char@, @zoom utf8 drawChar@ is 
    a /ByteString/ parser, returning a @Maybe Char@. @drawAll@ is a Parser that returns 
    a list of everything produced from a Producer, leaving only the return value; it would 
    usually be unreasonable to use it. But @zoom (splitAt 17) drawAll@
    returns a list of Text chunks containing the first seventeen Chars, and returns the rest of
    the Text Producer for further parsing. Suppose that we want, inexplicably, to 
    modify the casing of a Text Producer according to any instruction it might 
    contain at the start. Then we might write something like this:

>     obey :: Monad m => Producer Text m b -> Producer Text m b
>     obey p = do (ts, p') <- lift $ runStateT (zoom (Text.splitAt 7) drawAll) p
>                 let seven = T.concat ts
>                 case T.toUpper seven of 
>                    "TOUPPER" -> p' >-> Text.toUpper
>                    "TOLOWER" -> p' >-> Text.toLower
>                    _         -> do yield seven
>                                    p'


> >>> let doc = each ["toU","pperTh","is document.\n"]
> >>> runEffect $ obey doc >-> Text.stdout
> THIS DOCUMENT.

    The purpose of exporting lenses is the mental economy achieved with this three-way 
    applicability. That one expression, e.g. @lines@ or @splitAt 17@ can have these 
    three uses is no more surprising than that a pipe can act as a function modifying 
    the output of a producer, namely by using @>->@ to its left: @producer >-> pipe@
    -- but can /also/ modify the inputs to a consumer by using @>->@ to its right: 
    @pipe >-> consumer@

    The three functions, @view@ \/ @(^.)@, @over@ \/ @(%~)@ and @zoom@ are supplied by 
    both <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> and 
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family lens-family> The use of 'zoom' is explained
    in <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-parse-3.0.1/docs/Pipes-Parse-Tutorial.html Pipes.Parse.Tutorial> 
    and to some extent in the @Pipes.Text.Encoding@ module here. 

-}
{- $special
    These simple 'lines' examples reveal a more important difference from @Data.Text.Lazy@ . 
    This is in the types that are most closely associated with our central text type, 
    @Producer Text m r@.  In @Data.Text@ and @Data.Text.Lazy@ we find functions like

>   splitAt  :: Int -> Text -> (Text, Text)
>   lines    ::        Text -> [Text]
>   chunksOf :: Int -> Text -> [Text]

    which relate a Text with a pair of Texts or a list of Texts. 
    The corresponding functions here (taking account of \'lensification\') are 

>   view . splitAt  :: (Monad m, Integral n) => n -> Producer Text m r -> Producer Text m (Producer Text m r)
>   view lines      :: Monad m               =>      Producer Text m r -> FreeT (Producer Text m) m r
>   view . chunksOf :: (Monad m, Integral n) => n -> Producer Text m r -> FreeT (Producer Text m) m r

    Some of the types may be more readable if you imagine that we have introduced
    our own type synonyms

>   type Text m r  = Producer T.Text m r
>   type Texts m r = FreeT (Producer T.Text m) m r

    Then we would think of the types above as

>   view . splitAt  :: (Monad m, Integral n) => n -> Text m r -> Text m (Text m r)
>   view lines      :: (Monad m)             =>      Text m r -> Texts m r
>   view . chunksOf :: (Monad m, Integral n) => n -> Text m r -> Texts m r

    which brings one closer to the types of the similar functions in @Data.Text.Lazy@

    In the type @Producer Text m (Producer Text m r)@ the second 
    element of the \'pair\' of effectful Texts cannot simply be retrieved 
    with something like 'snd'. This is an \'effectful\' pair, and one must work 
    through the effects of the first element to arrive at the second Text stream, even
    if you are proposing to throw the Text in the first element away. 
    Note that we use Control.Monad.join to fuse the pair back together, since it specializes to 

>    join :: Monad m => Producer Text m (Producer m r) -> Producer m r

    The return type of 'lines', 'words', 'chunksOf' and the other /splitter/ functions,
    @FreeT (Producer m Text) m r@ -- our @Texts m r@ -- is the type of (effectful)
    lists of (effectful) texts. The type @([Text],r)@ might be seen to gather
    together things of the forms:

> r
> (Text,r)
> (Text, (Text, r))
> (Text, (Text, (Text, r)))
> (Text, (Text, (Text, (Text, r))))
> ...

    (We might also have identified the sum of those types with @Free ((,) Text) r@ 
    -- or, more absurdly, @FreeT ((,) Text) Identity r@.) 
    
    Similarly, our type @Texts m r@, or @FreeT (Text m) m r@ -- in fact called 
    @FreeT (Producer Text m) m r@ here -- encompasses all the members of the sequence:
   
> m r
> Text m r
> Text m (Text m r)
> Text m (Text m (Text m r))
> Text m (Text m (Text m (Text m r)))
> ...

    We might have used a more specialized type in place of @FreeT (Producer a m) m r@,
    or indeed of @FreeT (Producer Text m) m r@, but it is clear that the correct
    result type of 'lines' will be isomorphic to @FreeT (Producer Text m) m r@ . 

    One might think that 

>   lines :: Monad m => Lens' (Producer Text m r) (FreeT (Producer Text m) m r)
>   view . lines :: Monad m => Producer Text m r -> FreeT (Producer Text m) m r

    should really have the type
    
>   lines :: Monad m => Pipe Text Text m r

    as e.g. 'toUpper' does. But this would spoil the control we are 
    attempting to maintain over the size of chunks. It is in fact just 
    as unreasonable to want such a pipe as to want

> Data.Text.Lazy.lines :: Text -> Text 

    to 'rechunk' the strict Text chunks inside the lazy Text to respect 
    line boundaries. In fact we have 

> Data.Text.Lazy.lines :: Text -> [Text]
> Prelude.lines :: String -> [String]

    where the elements of the list are themselves lazy Texts or Strings; the use
    of @FreeT (Producer Text m) m r@ is simply the 'effectful' version of this. 
    
    The @Pipes.Group@ module, which can generally be imported without qualification,
    provides many functions for working with things of type @FreeT (Producer a m) m r@.
    In particular it conveniently exports the constructors for @FreeT@ and the associated
    @FreeF@ type -- a fancy form of @Either@, namely 
    
> data FreeF f a b = Pure a | Free (f b)

    for pattern-matching. Consider the implementation of the 'words' function, or 
    of the part of the lens that takes us to the words; it is compact but exhibits many 
    of the points under discussion, including explicit handling of the @FreeT@ and @FreeF@
    constuctors.  Keep in mind that 

>  newtype FreeT f m a  = FreeT (m (FreeF f a (FreeT f m a)))
>  next :: Monad m => Producer a m r -> m (Either r (a, Producer a m r))

   Thus the @do@ block after the @FreeT@ constructor is in the base monad, e.g. 'IO' or 'Identity';
   the later subordinate block, opened by the @Free@ constructor, is in the @Producer@ monad:

> words :: Monad m => Producer Text m r -> FreeT (Producer Text m) m r
> words p = FreeT $ do                   -- With 'next' we will inspect p's first chunk, excluding spaces;
>   x <- next (p >-> dropWhile isSpace)  --   note that 'dropWhile isSpace' is a pipe, and is thus *applied* with '>->'.
>   return $ case x of                   -- We use 'return' and so need something of type 'FreeF (Text m) r (Texts m r)'
>     Left   r       -> Pure r           -- 'Left' means we got no Text chunk, but only the return value; so we are done.
>     Right (txt, p') -> Free $ do       -- If we get a chunk and the rest of the producer, p', we enter the 'Producer' monad
>         p'' <- view (break isSpace)    -- When we apply 'break isSpace', we get a Producer that returns a Producer;
>                     (yield txt >> p')  --   so here we yield everything up to the next space, and get the rest back.
>         return (words p'')             -- We then carry on with the rest, which is likely to begin with space.
